### About me:

After my graduation in Geography, I started my professional career as an entrepreneur, creating and operating a bar and a nightclub. I have more than 10 years of experience in this field, working with hospitality from end to end. During my carreer I had the opportunity to acquire practical knowledge in team management, digital marketing, event planning, copywriting, sales and customer relationships. 

As a professional, I have always sought to offer meaningful experiences, striving for simplicity, elegance, and a keen attention to people's needs. In order to contribute more to business insights I'm currently shifitting my career and broadening my interests into tech and more specifically Data Science.
