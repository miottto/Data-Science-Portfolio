### About me:

After my graduation in Geography, I started my professional career as an entrepreneur, creating and operating a bar and a nightclub. I have more than 10 years of experience in this field, working with hospitality from end to end. During this trajectory, the use and manipulation of data aroused great interest in me. So now I'm currently shifitting my career into Data Science.
